# stock-analyzer
A Node.js-based web application that analyzes historical stock data using DSA algorithms like Stock Span, Moving Average, Sorting, and Binary Search.

The system allows users to add stock symbols, store stock data, perform financial analysis, and detect trends using efficient algorithms. The project integrates Back End Engineering (BEE) principles with DSA concepts to simulate a real-world financial analytics platform.
