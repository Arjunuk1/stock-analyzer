# stock-analyzer
A Node.js-based web application that analyzes historical stock data using DSA algorithms like Stock Span, Moving Average, Sorting, and Binary Search.

The system allows users to add stock symbols, store stock data, perform financial analysis, and detect trends using efficient algorithms. The project integrates Back End Engineering (BEE) principles with DSA concepts to simulate a real-world financial analytics platform.

🎯 Objective of the Project

To design a backend server using Node.js.

To implement REST APIs for stock management.

To perform real-time stock analysis using DSA algorithms.

To apply file-based storage instead of a database.

To demonstrate engineering-level backend system design.
